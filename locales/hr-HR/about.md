## About the project

### What is PoGo?

PoGo is an Windows 10 client for Niantic's Pokemon™ Go Android/iOS game. Being a client, this means that it gives you the ability to play in the same game-world as your friends that are playing with an Android or iOS device.

### Why PoGo?
 - Because learning new things is always cool
 - Because it could be done
 
### Current features
 - Login with Pokemon™ Trainer Club accounts
 - Similar UI as the Android/iOS version but 2D only
 - Use the map to see both Pokemons and PokeStops near your location
 - Catch Pokemons
 - Visit PokeStops and get new items
