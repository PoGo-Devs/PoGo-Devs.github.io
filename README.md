## Website of PoGo-UWP Project

If you can help with the internationalization of the website:
- Within the [Locales](https://github.com/PoGo-Devs/PoGo-Devs.github.io/tree/master/locales) folder, copy the `en-US` folder and rename it to the target language.
- Translate the files inside.
- Make a Pull Request. Done.

If it's not there yet, later the new language will be added to the website footer.
